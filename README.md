## Green prickly thing detector

The goal of the project is to build a model able to detect aerial cactus in environment.

I will be using [Aerial Cactus Identification](https://www.kaggle.com/c/aerial-cactus-identification) dataset, which is also a competition.  

In this project I will be using almost-custom-built API for image model training. API is capable to take any pretrained model and use it.

I will be working with 
- Xception
- MobileNetV2
- Custom built model without transfer learning
